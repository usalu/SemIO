abstract: "semio is an open ecosystem for component-based design of architecture. The decomposition of a design by a graph enables a collaborative, scalable and cross-platform design process. Instead of 3D-blobs, proprietary or documentary file formats from which it is difficult to extract individual parts, the heart of semio consists of a linked data model. All components can be easily shared, searched and reused. Unlike existing data models, not every design is squeezed into a handful of standard types such as floors, walls or windows. Instead, individual, complex and flexible types can be defined and freely combined via a generalized port mechanism."
