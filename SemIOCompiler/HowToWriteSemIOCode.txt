What do you need to follow to write a SemIO code:

If you want to just jump in and start to compile go \SemIOCode\Template.sio file and just exchange
the text in caps with your own names and add or remove some parameters.

Here is some background information:

There are 3 important keywords: AbstractionLevel, Object, Parameter

The most important syntax rule you need to follow is that behind every keyword 
and their values need to be a specific amount of spaces units.
You can insert as much white spaces (space, tab, newline) as you like anywhere BUT before the keyword.

One space unit is either way
	one tab or 
    4 spaces.

Here are the examples:
AbstractionLevel ABSTRACTIONLEVELNAME (needs 0 space unit before the keyword "AbstractionLevel")

	Object OBJECTNAME (needs 1 space unit before the keyword "Object")
		PARAMETERTYPE PARAMETERNAME (needs 1 space unit before the PARAMETERTYPE)
		ANOTHERPARAMETERTYPE ANOTHERPARAMETERTYPENAME

	Parameter PARAMETERTYPENAME (needs 1 space unit before the keyword "Parameter")
		VALUENAME (needs 2 space units before VALUENAME)
		ANOTHERVALUENAME

Everything writting in caps is not strict and you have to choose a name that fits your need.

With the keyword Parameter you define your own PARAMETERTYPE that can be used as a parameter for your object type.

There are a few already defined PARAMETERTYPEs:

Text, Number, NaturalNumber, Integer, Percent, TrueOrFalse, 
Point, Vector, Curve, ClosedCurve, Line, PolyLine, Surface, Solid

Besides that you can a description to everything like with quotation marks

" YOUR DESCRIPTION"
AbstractionLevel ABSTRACTIONLEVELNAME

	" YOUR DESCRIPTION NEEDS TO START WITH THE SAME SPACE UNIT COUNT
BUT CAN END SOMEWHERE DIFFRENT AND CONTAIN ANY CHARACTER LIKE # , .-!"ยง$%&/()=?
		AS LONG AS IT ENDS WITH A QUOTATION MARK"

	Object OBJECTNAME (needs 1 space unit before the keyword "Object")
		PARAMETERTYPE PARAMETERNAME (needs 1 space unit before the PARAMETERTYPE)
		ANOTHERPARAMETERTYPE ANOTHERPARAMETERTYPENAME


I will not talk about the things in brackets. You don't have to understand for now.
(Basicially round bracket means innheritance and sqaure bracket is type speciication
but don't worry if that doesn't make any sense to you.)

Hopefully that's enough for you to write your first SemIO code.

Good luck in trying, have fun!
