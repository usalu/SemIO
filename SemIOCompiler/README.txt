Hello stranger,

nice that you want to try out SemIO! Just start SemIOCompiler.exe and create a (or use an existing *.sio) file.
Maybe you can guess the syntax from the files? One hint: Use a single tab or 4 spaces for a spacer unit.

Writing a new file is as easy as that:
1. Start a text editor
2. Write some code
3. Change the extension from *.txt to *.sio
(If you can't see you extensions:
1. Go to the tab "View" in your windows explorer and set a tick in "Show extensions".
This checkbox should be on the right top of you windows explorer window)

Make sure to place your file into the folder \SemIOCode\YOURFILE.sio

And that's it.The rest you will figure it out!

The compiled assembly and generated C# and VB Code are located under the folder \CompilerResults
which will be automatically declared in the output directory.

Have fun!
