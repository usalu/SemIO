# SemIO
 A domain-specific scripting language for architects which helps to create project specific framework. The main purpose of SemIO is to create a design tool for architects that can store abstract information digitally and be used at the same time to generate an assembly (DLL) that withholds the same information. A simple text file is enough to notate a concept and test it instantly digitally.
